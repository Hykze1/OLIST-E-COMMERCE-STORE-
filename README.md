# INTRODUCTION
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online. 

The Olist sales dataset available on Kaggle is a collection of anonymized data about orders placed on the Olist platform between January 2017 and August 2018. It contains a wide range of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. The dataset also includes information about the sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as data on customer behavior and demographics. The dataset is designed to help analysts and researchers better understand the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and identify opportunities for growth and optimization. 

To help Olist gain better insights into their e-commerce platform and optimize available opportunities for growth, you are to provide answers to the business questions below:

# WHAT IS THE TOTAL REVENUE GENERATED BY OLIST, AND HOW HAS IT CHANGED OVER TIME?
WE JOIN THE TABLE AS REQUIRED

WE check for dupplicate 

--In most database systems, the primary key of a table is used to uniquely identify each row in that table. Therefore, the primary key column (often named 'order_id') is expected to have unique values for each row, and duplicate values are not allowed.

Having duplicate values in the primary key column would violate the fundamental principle of data integrity and could lead to
inconsistencies and errors in the database. Each primary key value serves as a unique identifier for a specific record, and duplicates
would create ambiguity in identifying and accessing individual records.

We deleted the duplicates, checked for nulls and data types

Now let compute for the total revenue. Total Revenue = (Price of the Product + Shipping Fee) * payment_sequential

This will account for cases where payments are made or multiple payments are associated with a single transaction.
